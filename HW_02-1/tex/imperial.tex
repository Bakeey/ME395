We again get the displacement signal, this time for the imperial earthquake.

\end{figure}

Next, we get the velocity profile using a differentiation filter. 

In general, the procedure is the same as for the Chichi earthquake.

We use the forward difference (Euler forward) and central difference filter in figure \ref{imperial_velocity}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics*[width=0.75\columnwidth]{imperial_velocity.pdf}
    \caption{Imperial earthquake velocity, computed via filter.}
    \label{imperial_velocity}
\end{figure}

We see that the computed velocity signals seem to be generall in agreement. Now, we can derive the acceleration signal by differentiating again. 

First, we perform differentiation using the central difference method on the velocity data 
computed from the displacement profile using central difference.

Secondly, we perform backward difference on the forward difference velocity profile.

Third, we obtain the acceleration profile directly from the displacement measurement using second-order 
finite difference. The results can be seen in figure \ref{imperial_acceleration}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics*[width=0.75\columnwidth]{imperial_acceleration.pdf}
    \caption{Imperial earthquake acceleration, computed via filter.}
    \label{imperial_acceleration}
\end{figure}

Lastly, we can plot the difference between the acceleration derived by differentiation from the velocity 
profiles to the one directly differentiated from the displacement profile. We can again see that there is no 
difference between taking forward and backward difference to taking second order central difference directly 
(apart from the edges, due to padding).

We can also again see that applying first-order central difference is less accurate.
